# Project-1
# Introduction
I plan to analyze how the population density and GINI index of each county of Pennsylvania influences reported covid death rates. I want to determine the effect of the disparty between death rates in densely populated cities and in less densly populated rural areas and see if there is a correlation in death rate. I also want to determine the effects that income inequality has on the death rate through looking at the gini index of each county. The inability for a large percent of people the afford proper health care in a county with a high gini index could correspond to an increase in death rate. Covid data was gathered from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data and the GINI index and population density was gathered from census.gov.

From the plot, it can be observed that there is a pretty clear increase in death rate as the population density increases. Below I have plotted the data excluding Philidelphia and Delaware (the two highest population counties) to get a better view at the lower population density data.

Et can be seen that the majority of the data can be observed to follow a linear trend with increasing population density.

From this plot, there seems to be a slight correlation between increasing gini index and an increase in the number of deaths. Although, the data is not nearly as clear is that of the population density.

When looking at the two variables studied, gini index and population density, it can be observed that the data for the most part seems independent. If anything there is a very slight dependance which should not impact my analysis.
