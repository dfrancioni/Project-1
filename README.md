# Project-1
I plan to analyze how the population density and GINI index of each county influences reported covid death rates. I want to determine the effect of the disparty between transmission in densely populated cities and out west in less densly populated areas and see if there is a correlation in death rate. Covid data was gathered from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
