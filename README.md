# Project-1
# Introduction
I plan to analyze how the population density and GINI index of each county of Pennsylvania influences reported covid death rates. I want to determine the effect of the disparty between death rates in densely populated cities and in less densly populated rural areas and see if there is a correlation in death rate. I also want to determine the effects that income inequality has on the death rate through looking at the gini index of each county. The inability for a large percent of people the afford proper health care in a county with a high gini index could correspond to an increase in death rate. Covid data was gathered from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data and the GINI index and population density was gathered from census.gov.
# Population Density vs Death Rates in PA

From the plot, it can be observed that there is a pretty clear increase in death rate as the population density increases.
